4/2/2021: Materials for a unit plan on beginning data visualization with Python. I've created the performance tasks that comprise the summative assessments for the unit. My next job is to write lesson plans and formative assessments leading to each of these performance tasks. What are some likely student misconceptions / sticking points for this content? What feedback do CS teachers have on this work so far?

Note that the Jupyter Notebook files contain sample responses that would be absent from student-facing versions.

4/13/2021: Created student classwork and homework/discussion materials for lessons 1-4.

4/14/2021: Created student classwork and homework/discussion materials for lessons 5, 6. Added babynames dataset.

4/15/2021: Completed all unit plan components. Ready for feedback.
